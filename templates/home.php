			Hour to fly from Lima to Trujillo airport which is located not a ten-minute taxi journey away from us. Buses from Lima to Trujillo leaves daily and there are many bus companies to choose from. Travel by bus takes nine hours and all the buses arrive to Trujillo where you need to take a bus or a taxi to reach the Huanchaco. Trujillo to Huanchaco is about 15 kilometers distance. Tell taxi driver to take you "en frente de municipalidad" and we are just about in front of it.
